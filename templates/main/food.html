                    <h3>Mature RFID technology is ready to take on the food industry</h3>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                        Radio frequency identification (RFID) has become established as a dominant force in the apparel industry,
                        with the technology finally approaching mass adoption after years of threatening to.
                        The technology involves tags or “labels” that emit a small radio frequency, allowing radio
                        stock counts that are both highly accurate and incredibly fast compared to traditional methods. 
                        The result of this is a very up to date, or even real-time, view of stock. The main use cases responsible for 
                        the technology’s success include the increased process efficiency, superior inventory management and the enablement 
                        of seamless omnichannel services.<br/><br/><br/>
                        That’s the story of RFID in apparel, but what about other retail industries? After years of 
                        technical roadblocks that have kept the technology out of other markets, the technology has 
                        matured to a point where new industries are RFID-viable for the first time ever. The beauty and 
                        cosmetics industry is beginning to take notice of RFID, and perhaps now food retailers should do the same.
                        Why? Because modern RFID is so well positioned to tackle the food industry’s unique challenges,
                        like optimising inventory, minimising food waste and increasing the traceability of the supply chain.
                        Whilst this sounds great, the limitations of the technology that we mentioned earlier have 
                        historically meant RFID just wasn’t viable for the food market. As well as liquid and metallic products 
                        traditionally interfering with the RFID signals, the food industry’s drastically lower average article price 
                        compared to the apparel industry were significant roadblocks. But this changing…
