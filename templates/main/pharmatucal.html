                            <h1>RFID labels benefits manufacturers, hospitals and patients</h1>
                            Patient safety is paramount when it comes to pharmaceutical products and medical devices. 
                            That is why certain types of labels are mandatory for manufacturers, for instance to prevent 
                            counterfeit drugs or foods from being sold. Improved visibility along the entire delivery and 
                            value chain also increases economic efficiency for transport and stock levels.

                            <h1> RFID labels increases protection against counterfeiting</h1>
                            Every year, product piracy costs the industry several billion US dollars. Profits are not only
                            impacted by the sales of counterfeit and manipulated medication. Pharmaceutics companies also 
                            pay the price of damaged reputations and illegitimate product-liability cases. Product marking
                            plays a key role in anti-counterfeiting measures.

                            <strong>Tiny transponders</strong> in RFID labels store individual product information. If needed, the 
                            information can be quickly accessed for real-time tracking and authentication. Paired with 
                            special RFID readers, these labels can even be used to detect possible manipulation and serve 
                            as an effective deterrent.
