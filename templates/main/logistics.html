                        ability to support an incredibly versatile range of applications. Why is RFID being used so much 
                        in this sector in particular, and how could you make the most of it?</strong>
                        <h3>Automated Ticketing for Public Transport</h3>
                        This clever use of RFID is not only great for speeding up the process of issuing tickets for the transport company 
                        themselves, but it also benefits their consumers. How so? As we discussed before, RFID technology doesnâ€™t require a 
                        line of sight to be used and so it is extremely versatile and quick to use. This helps to reduce queuing times and 
                        human errors which in turn will maximize customer satisfaction!
                        <h3>RFID tags on vehicles</h3>
                        This method is often used to track when vehicles arrive back at the depot, this then accurately keeps a record of the 
                        available vehicles at any given time! Other applications include vehicle identification when arriving at a site. 
                        These two ways of using RFID greatly contribute to faster business processes, planning and in turn the overall success
                        of the whole transportation company.
                        <h3>Hiring Equipment</h3>
                        If your company offers equipment hire to customers, equipping the assets with RFID tags can help 
                        to reduce the possibility of losses and theft. Tagging the equipment and having them actively 
                        scanned along their journey will help you to keep full control of things like the location and 
                        use times.
