            <p>
                
                The use of RFID technology in the manufacturing process offers many benefits to a manufacturing
                process. RFID can reduce the amount of paper needed to create the product, it allows for better 
                tracking of inventory, more accurate status of WIP, fewer manufacturing errors and a higher 
                quality product. Capturing the benefits of RFID technology in this arena is relatively easy 
                compared to some other applications because the RFID tags can be of the passive type and can be
                reused. It makes the value proposition very attractive for that reason alone.
